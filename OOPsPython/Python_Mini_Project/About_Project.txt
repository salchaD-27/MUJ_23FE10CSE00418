CLI Quiz Platform
This project is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) Quiz Application designed to offer an interactive and educational quiz experience directly from the terminal. 
Built with Python, the application emphasizes simplicity, versatility, and ease of use while offering engaging features commonly found in advanced quiz platforms. 
It is ideal for users looking to test their knowledge on various subjects, challenge themselves with timed quizzes, and track their progress over time.

The quiz application includes features such as multiple categories, progressive difficulty, hints with score penalties, and a dynamic leaderboard. 
With these features, users can:
1. Select from various categories or topics for a personalized quiz experience.
2. Enjoy adaptive difficulty levels, where the quiz adjusts based on their performance.
3. Use hints if they are unsure, with a small penalty to encourage learning without overly impacting their scores.
4. View a leaderboard that ranks users based on scores, encouraging friendly competition and motivation.
5. Track time for each question and view performance analytics to understand strengths and areas for improvement.

In addition to these user-focused features, the CLI Quiz Platform also allows users to:
1. Create accounts and log in to save and resume progress.
2. View a breakdown of performance by topic or category, gaining insight into knowledge gaps.
3. Review missed questions and correct answers, supporting effective learning through reflection.
4. With a simple text-based interface, this project is lightweight and requires no special hardware, making it accessible on most systems with Python installed. 
It serves as both a knowledge-testing tool and a fun way to learn new information, blending education with entertainment.
